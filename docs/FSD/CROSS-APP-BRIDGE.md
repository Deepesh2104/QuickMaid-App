# FSD — Cross-App Bridge (Customer ↔ Partner Demo)

**Status:** `UI-DEMO`  
**Scope:** `QuickMaid-App/shared/`, `apps/partner/shared/`, `apps/customer/shared/`

## Overview

Demo-only bridge so customer orders, partner lifecycle, live location, cancel/reschedule sync across apps — **without a backend**. Works when both apps share the same device AsyncStorage (simulator / web) or via deep link handoff.

Production replaces this with QuickMaid-API dispatch webhooks and real-time location API.

### Storage keys

| Key | Constant | Purpose |
|-----|----------|---------|
| `@qm/booking_partner_bridge_v1` | `BOOKING_PARTNER_BRIDGE_KEY` | New orders queue |
| `@qm/booking_status_bridge_v1` | `BOOKING_STATUS_BRIDGE_KEY` | Lifecycle events by `bookingRef` |

| `@qm/pending_visit_complete` | `VISIT_COMPLETE_BRIDGE_KEY` | One-shot visit complete modal payload |

### Status bridge events

| Event | Publisher | Consumer |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| `partner_accepted` | Partner (manual + auto-assign) | Customer → update pro name, notification |
| `partner_in_progress` | Partner start visit | Customer → notification, live track |
| `partner_completed` | Partner OTP complete | Customer → mark completed + visit modal |
| `partner_declined` | Partner decline | Customer → reassignment notification |
| `customer_cancelled` | Customer cancel | Partner → decline job |
| `customer_rescheduled` | Customer reschedule | Partner → patch visit date/slot |

## Flow — customer order → partner job

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant C as Customer Checkout
  participant B as booking-bridge
  participant P as Partner refresh
  participant J as PartnerJobsContext

  C->>B: pushBookingToPartnerBridge(order)
  P->>B: syncCustomerBookingBridge()
  P->>J: ingest → pending job
```

## Flow — lifecycle sync

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant P as PartnerJobsContext
  participant S as booking-status bridge
  participant C as useUserBookings.refresh

  P->>S: publish partner_accepted / in_progress / completed
  C->>S: syncBookingsFromPartnerStatusBridge()
  C->>C: patch booking + notifications
```

## Flow — live location

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant PD as Partner JobDetail (in_progress)
  participant VL as visit-location bridge
  participant TR as Customer Track screen

  PD->>PD: auto-start live share on visit start
  PD->>VL: GPS ping every ~15s
  TR->>VL: poll every 8s
  TR->>TR: real coords + ETA
```

## Metro bundling

Both apps pin Metro `projectRoot` to their app folder and import from `apps/{app}/shared/`. Do not import monorepo `shared/` directly from `src/` — copy files and keep in sync.

## Flow — visit complete handoff

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant P as Partner OTP complete
  participant S as booking-status bridge
  participant V as visit-complete bridge
  participant C as BookingVisitCompleteModal

  P->>S: partner_completed
  C->>S: syncBookingsFromPartnerStatusBridge()
  C->>V: setPendingVisitComplete(payload)
  C->>C: BookingVisitCompleteModal (2000x premium)
```

## Batch 4 UI (live location)

| Component | App | Role |
|-----------|-----|------|
| `PartnerLiveLocationCard` | Partner | Auto GPS share on visit · bridge write |
| `PartnerLiveVisitBanner` | Partner | Schedule in-progress hero |
| `PartnerActiveJobBanner` | Partner | Home live visit CTA |
| `BookingLiveLocationCard` | Customer | Detail live ping card |
| `BookingTrackScreen` + `BookingTrackMap` | Customer | Real GPS map position |
| `BookingUpcomingHero` | Customer | GPS LIVE badge when sharing |
| `usePartnerLivePing` | Customer | Shared 8s poll hook |

## Batch 1 UI (foundation)

| Component | Screen | Role |
|-----------|--------|------|
| `CheckoutPartnerBridgeCard` | Checkout success | Order → partner bridge pipeline |
| `BookingVisitCompleteModal` | Bookings / Detail | Bridge-synced completion celebration |

## Demo OTP

All visit completion OTPs use `123456` (`DEMO_OTP`) for cross-app demo parity.

## Phase 4 replacement

| Demo | Production |
|------|------------|
| AsyncStorage bridges | API webhooks + FCM |
| Deep link payload | Push notification + fetch |
| Location bridge | `POST /jobs/:id/location` + customer tracking API |
